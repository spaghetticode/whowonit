%p It's been a while since ebay changed its policy: now the winner of an auction remains undisclosed to all other ebayers but the seller. But there is still a chance to find out who won that auction: sooner or later feedback should be left, and it will include the buyer ebay id. 
%p Start to track auctions right now, and as soon as a tracked auction gets its feedback from the buyer we will nofify you via email with the buyer ebay id. Tracked auctions will stay visible on this website for 90 days after auction close.
